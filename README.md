# About the project
  The project is an Auto Responder system that sends emails automatically to registered clients.

## How the project work's 
  The project is  built using python.
  First the client leave's their details on a landing page , then the details are moved to the DB that the site is connected to. 
  Once a day ( a time that the system manager chooses) the program collects the data from the remote DB
  and then  compares it to the local client's list to see if a new client has been added. 
  Eventually, after going through the clients list's the system send's  emails automatically to all the clients.
